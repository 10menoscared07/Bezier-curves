# Bezier-curves
Bezier curves are polynomial curves that are drawn using pre-defined control and anchor points.

Today i have just done a simple visualization for the quadratic bezier curves which has two control points and one anchor point.
I have also drawn the string art style of drawing a bezier curve.
